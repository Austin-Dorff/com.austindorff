    <p>I am a nineteen year-old graduate of Dev Bootcamp Inc. in Chicago. I grew up watching the Discovery, History, and Military channels, and consequently, from an early age I was always testing, and improving my mechanical abilities and my mechanical IQ. I was always eager to take things apart and re-engineer them in an attempt to improve their functionality and usability. I discovered software development four years ago through the creation of Minecraft modifications and teaching myself how to write code in Java. I realized that many of the principles I learned through the testing, designing, and re-designing of these mechanical endeavors were transferable into the world of software development. I immensely enjoy most activities, such as software development, that challenge my mathematical and analytical abilites. I knew that software development was a promising career path and also that I loved it so I enrolled at Loyola Marymount Univeristy in Los Angeles, California as a computer science major to further my pursuit of a software development career. After attending LMU for half a semester, I realized that I did not want to spend as much as 40% of my time in humanities classes. I withdrew from LMU to enroll in a coding bootcamp, Dev Bootcamp, to continue my pursuit of software development and graduated in April of 2016. I am looking to secure a full-time junior software developer position with duties that will include discussing objectives and writing tests, as well as writing code.</p>
